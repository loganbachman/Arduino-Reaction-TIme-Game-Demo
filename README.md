# Arduino-Reaction-TIme-Game-Demo
Game Description:
The objective of my game is to test your reaction time, 
the board will light up and record a reaction time based off of how fast you press the button. 
It will print that time so you can see it and try to improve. 
There will be levels varying in difficulty that progressively need a faster reaction time to move on.
